# Large Language Models (LLMs)

## 1. How to utilize a model via API
Application Programming Interface (API) is a way to interact with a remote application programmatically. Instead of going to any website and typing the prompt we can do this via API. so in python we type the prompt and with this API we can send requests and receive a response from the model.<br>
Using API we can customize the system messages, we can adjust the input parameters like max response length, no of responses and temperature, process images and other files, extract helpful word embeddings for downstream tasks, input audio for transcription and translation, model fine-tuning functionality.<br>

## 2. How to use Open Source Models from Hugging Face
There are thousands of open source pre-trained ML models available for free. The datasets repository which are also available for free to train our own models or for fine-tuning. Hugging Face Spaces is a platform to build and deploy ML models.<br>
Transformers is a python library which makes downloading and training ML models super easy. Initially it was only for NLP; now it can be used for any domain. We can use its pipeline function to perform many tasks.<br>
